# momomagick

A python toolbox for manipulating 2D/3D microscope multichannel time-lapse images saved in the TIFF or OME-TIFF format (X-Y-C-Z-T), especially those acquired with the [diSPIM light-sheet microscope](http://dispim.org) using [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/). The python scripts in this toolbox are used in our next paper, whose preprint will be available soon.

**momomagick** was named after [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/), the famous software for controlling microscope hardware, [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) and also after our hamster, **Momo**, who survived the COVID-19 pandemic with our family.

## Introduction

**momomagick** is a set of python scripts to handle 2D/3D images saved in the TIFF or OME-TIFF format. In this document, the basic usage of the scripts are described using the following sample images.
* time_lapse_2d.tif (in prep) - image cropping and registration
* time_lapse_3d.tif (in prep) - image cropping and registration
* single_channel_3d.tif (in prep) - deconvolution
* dual_channel_3d.tif (in prep) - fusion and deconvolution of dual-channel images

**Note:** Sample images and output images will be uploaded soon.

**Note:** Scripts in this toolkit were written for my TIF/OME-TIFF images acquired using diSPIM and MicroManager, which has the voxel size of 162.5 nm x 162.5 nm x 500 nm (X-Y-Z). The image resolution will fall back to these values when it is not available from the image file. **Keep your eyes on the log messages especially when you handle 3D images.**

## Getting Started

### Requirements

First of all, download and install the following programs.

* [`Python 3.12.1 or later`](https://www.python.org)
* [`Fiji (recommended)`](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/)
* [`Git (recommended)`](https://git-scm.com/)

Next, install the following packages to your Python environment using pip. You can install these packages directly to the Python system, but it is highly recommended to prepare [a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and install packages on it. In this case, make sure to activate the virtual environment before running the program.

* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `scipy`
* `Pillow`
* `tifffile`
* `ome-types`
* `NumpyEncoder`
* `statsmodels`
* `transforms3d` -- make sure to install "transforms3d", not transform3d
* `progressbar2` -- make sure to install "progressbar2", not progressbar

All of these libraries can be installed using `pip` by typing:
```
pip install numpy pandas scipy Pillow tifffile ome-types NumpyEncoder statsmodels transforms3d progressbar2
```

**Note:** Some scripts in this toolkit can work faster using nVidia GPU and cupy. For this purpose, setup the `CUDA environment` using guides (available for [Windows](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html) and [Linux](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)). Then, install `cupy` using pip. GPU calculation is not activated by default. Use `-g 0` (the number may change when your workstation has multiple GPU boards) for GPU calculation.

### Installation

Download the zip file from my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/takushim/momomagick) and place all the files in an appropriate folder, for example, `C:\Users\[username]\momomagick` or `C:\Users\[username]\bin\momomagick`. Add the installed folder to the `PATH` environment variable.

**Note:** If you are using PowerShell, add `.PY` to the PATHEXT environment variable. Otherwise, Python will start in a separate window and finishes soon.

If [git](https://git-scm.com/) is installed, my git repository can be cloned using the following commend:
```
git clone https://github.com/takushim/momomagick.git
```

### Scripts in this toolkit

**Note:** Use `--help` option for the detailed usage.

This documents explains the usages of the following scripts.
* `mmcrop.py` - image cropping
* `mmregister.py`- registration of time-lapse images
* `mmdeconv.py` - deconvolution
* `mmfusion.py` - fusion and deconvolution of dual-channel images

Usages of these scripts are **not** covered by this documents.
* `mmlifetime.py` - calculate lifetime distribution or regression curves from the json file output from [momotrack](https://github.com/takushim/momotrack)
* `mmmark.py` - draw markers on images using the json file output from [momotrack](https://github.com/takushim/momotrack), especially used for images converted to 8 bit.
* `mmspotfilter.py` - filter the json file output from [momotrack](https://github.com/takushim/momotrack)
* `mmoverlay.py` - register two image stacks and output one multi-channel image

Algorithms are provided by the modules in the `mmtools` folder.
* `deconvolve.py` - deconvolution using cpu or gpu
* `draw.py` - draw various markers
* `gpuimage.py` - manipulate images using cpu or gpu
* `lifetime.py` - calculate lifetime distribution or regression curves
* `log.py` - logger
* `mmtiff.py` - obsolete and retained for compatibility
* `particles.py` - handle tracking records output from [momotrack](https://github.com/takushim/momotrack)
* `register.py` - register two images using cpu or gpu
* `stack.py` - load TIFF/OME-TIFF files  (optimized for MicroManager)
* `trackj.py` - obsolete and retained for compatibility

The `psf` folder contains images of PSF (point spread function) for the diSPIM microscope output generated using [`PSF Generator`](https://bigwww.epfl.ch/algorithms/psfgenerator/). You may want to check the `sh` folder for actual usages.

## Cropping

`mmcrop.py` simply crop 2D/3D images. The output images will be used by other scripts. The output filename is `XXX_crop.tif` unless otherwise specified. The `-R` option specifies the cropping area by `X Y Width Height`. Use `-z` and `-t` options to specify the range along the z and t axes. You can use `-c` option to select one channel. 

Usage:
```
mmcrop.py -R 0 0 256 256 time_lapse_2d.tif
mmcrop.py -R 0 0 256 256 time_lapse_3d.tif
```

## Registration

`mmregister.py` corrects sample drift during the time-lapse imaging. The output filename is `XXX_reg.tif` unless otherwise specified. The area used for registration can be specified by the `-R` option by `X Y Width Height`. The reference image can be specified by the `-r` option.

Image registration is preformed after applying a Hanning window. The following algorithms are available for registration. The algorithm for optimization should be `Powell` or `Nelder-Mead` in most cases (ignored for some registration algorithms, such as POC). GPU calculation is highly recommended for processing 3D images.

* `None` - do nothing
* `INTPOC` - pixel-order phase only correlation
* `POC` - subpixel-order phase only correlation
* `XY`- drift along the X-Y axes only
* `Drift` - drift only
* `Rigid` - drift + rotation (rigid body)
* `Rigid-Zoom` - drift + rotation + zoom
* `Full` - Full optimization of the affine matrix

Usage for CPU calculation:
```
mmregister.py -e POC -t Powell time_lapse_2d.tif
mmregister.py -e Rigid -t Powell time_lapse_3d.tif
```

Usage for GPU calculation:
```
mmregister.py -g 0 -e POC -t Powell time_lapse_2d.tif
mmregister.py -g 0 -e Rigid -t Powell time_lapse_3d.tif
```

## Deconvolution

`mmdeconv.py` deconvolves 3D images using a PSF function saved in a TIFF image. Files in the `PSF` folder are automatically selected and used unless otherwise specified. The output filename is `XXX_deconv.tif` by default. The algorithm is Richardsonâ€“Lucy. The `-i` option specifies the number of iteration.

**Note:** This script accepts 2D images, but deconvolution of 2D images is not recommended.

**Note:** The pixel size of PSF images are 165 nm x 165 nm x 165 nm or 165 nm x 165 nm x 500 nm. **Prepare a PSF image for your microscope setting and load it using the `-p` option**.

Usage (GPU calculation highly recommended):
```
mmregister.py -g 0 -i 10 -s single_channel_3d.tif
```

## Fusion of two channels for diSPIM imaging

The diSPIM microscope can image samples through volume scans in two directions perpendicular to each other. `mmfusion.py` selects two channels from a 3D image (`-m` and `-s`), rotate one channel (`-s`) by 90 or -90 degrees (`-r`) along the Y axis and fuses the two channels after registration (`-e Full`). Deconvolution will be performed when the `-i` option is specified. See the sample image and the output for the detail.

Usage (GPU calculation highly recommended):

```
mmfusion.py -g 0 -m 0 -s 1 -r 90 -e Full dual_channel_3d.tif
```
